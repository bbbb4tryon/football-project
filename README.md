Football Leagues Around the World is a site dedicated to unmatched, to the nanosecond updates for footie*. Don't feel like a pendulous fool if the moment before you click, you feel drained and limpid - your life is about to change for the better.  If you think "football" is the NFL, don't. There is much more corruption, nepotism and arrogance than in America - and that's just from the software engineers.

Here at FLAW, you'll be educated on how to dispel that awkward, empty feeling when the moment arrives. You'll feel confident and be effective in your performance - whether at the pub, the stadium, camping with friends or even a caravan of strangers. Your friends will love what you gained from FLAW and all for free - no 30-day trial, no BOGO, nothing to stop you from gushing turgid verses of achingly earnest footie stats. Freedom is discussing when Arsenal lost the top spot to City and how GZ City compares with the others of the Chinese Super League, all gained from regular visits and use.

--What Platform Does FLAW work best on?--
Most any - we've found Chrome and Youtube are the most reliable browsers/platforms.

--How to Install It (including prerequisites and why):--
One does not need to install anything**, unless one does not have Chrome, then one should install Chrome. It is also a best-practice to have speakers on one's machine to hear the vid'.

--How to Run it (common use cases, where to get information on getting complex):--
Press "Enter" after one types the web address. 

--Common Errors (both installing and running):--
One should know that one is in error if one thinks "football" involves a viewership of John Madden and the World and is larger that the English Premier League. Over the course of the 2021 season, average viewership of American Football was 17.1 million per week, and the English Premier League was 79 million per week.  John Madden would have loved that average viewership count of his beloved football. But he can't because he's dead. Error.  

A common running error, is trying to run two JSON servers simultaneously. Close other JSON watches.  If one tries to run a server while another is running, port 3000 balks.  If unknown server locations already are using port 3000, enter the following in the CLI:
sudo lsof -i :3000
((this will list all PID listening on this port, once you have the PID you can terminate it with the following:))

kill -9 <PID>
((where you replace <PID> by the process ID, or the list of process IDs, the previous command output.))
